# ML Classification Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees

## üìå Project Overview
This repository contains my work for **Problem Set 2** of my Machine Learning course.  
The focus of this assignment is on **supervised learning for classification tasks**, covering the following models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
The project explores how these classification algorithms perform under different dataset conditions and evaluates their predictive power.

## üìä Methods and Techniques
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression**
- Used for **binary classification** problems.
- Estimates probabilities using the **sigmoid function**.
- Evaluates model performance with **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Finds the **optimal hyperplane** that maximizes the margin between classes.
- Uses different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle non-linearly separable data.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** with grid search for `C` and `gamma`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- A **non-parametric model** that classifies based on the majority vote of `k` nearest neighbors.
- Performance highly dependent on the choice of `k`.
- **Distance metrics**: Euclidean, Manhattan.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Trees**
- Constructs a tree-based model by **iterative feature splitting**.
- **Gini impurity & entropy** as splitting criteria.
- Can be prone to **overfitting** if not pruned properly.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC-AUC Curve for Model Performance Comparison**

## üìà Key Findings
- **Logistic Regression performs well for linearly separable data**, but struggles with non-linear patterns.
- **SVM with RBF kernel outperforms logistic regression** on complex datasets.
- **KNN is sensitive to the choice of `k`**, where small values cause overfitting, and large values lead to underfitting.
- **Decision Trees capture complex patterns** but tend to overfit without pruning or depth control.
- **Hyperparameter tuning significantly impacts model performance** (e.g., SVM's `C` and `gamma` values).

## üìå Future Improvements
- **Experiment with Ensemble Methods** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- **Implement Feature Scaling** to see its effect on SVM and KNN performance.
- **Compare with Deep Learning models** such as Neural Networks.
- **Optimize Hyperparameters** using Bayesian Optimization instead of Grid Search.
